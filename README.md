3. You will add any security features to server.js

4. Write the following tests in tests/2_functional-tests.js:
   -  Creating a new thread: POST request to /api/threads/{board}
   -  Viewing the 10 most recent threads with 3 replies each: GET request to /api/threads/{board}
   - Deleting a thread with the incorrect password: DELETE request to /api/threads/{board} with an invalid delete_password
   - Deleting a thread with the correct password: DELETE request to /api/threads/{board} with a valid delete_password
   - Reporting a thread: PUT request to /api/threads/{board}
   - Creating a new reply: POST request to /api/replies/{board}
   - Viewing a single thread with all replies: GET request to /api/replies/{board}
   - Deleting a reply with the incorrect password: DELETE request to /api/replies/{board} with an invalid delete_password
   - Deleting a reply with the correct password: DELETE request to /api/replies/{board} with a valid delete_password
   - Reporting a reply: PUT request to /api/replies/{board}

## User Story

1. You can provide your own project, not the example URL.

2. Only allow your site to be loaded in an iFrame on your own pages.

3. Do not allow DNS prefetching.

4. Only allow your site to send the referrer for your own pages.

5. You can send a POST request to /api/threads/{board} with form data including text and delete_password. The saved database record will have at least the fields _id, text, created_on(date & time), bumped_on(date & time, starts same as created_on), reported (boolean), delete_password, & replies (array).

6. You can send a POST request to /api/replies/{board} with form data including text, delete_password, & thread_id. This will update the bumped_on date to the comment's date. In the thread's replies array, an object will be saved with at least the properties _id, text, created_on, delete_password, & reported.

7. You can send a GET request to /api/threads/{board}. Returned will be an array of the most recent 10 bumped threads on the board with only the most recent 3 replies for each. The reported and delete_password fields will not be sent to the client.

8. You can send a GET request to /api/replies/{board}?thread_id={thread_id}. Returned will be the entire thread with all its replies, also excluding the same fields from the client as the previous test.

9. You can send a DELETE request to /api/threads/{board} and pass along the thread_id & delete_password to delete the thread. Returned will be the string incorrect password or success.

10. You can send a DELETE request to /api/replies/{board} and pass along the thread_id, reply_id, & delete_password. Returned will be the string incorrect password or success. On success, the text of the reply_id will be changed to [deleted].

11. You can send a PUT request to /api/threads/{board} and pass along the thread_id. Returned will be the string success. The reported value of the thread_id will be changed to true.

12. You can send a PUT request to /api/replies/{board} and pass along the thread_id & reply_id. Returned will be the string success. The reported value of the reply_id will be changed to true.

13. All 10 functional tests are complete and passing.
